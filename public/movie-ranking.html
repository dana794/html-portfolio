<h1>The Best Movies According to Matt</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
	This is one of my favorite movies of all time because i love Tom Hanks as an
	actor. He does such a good job portraying the character in a realistic and
	believeable way. I love how they incorporate real life elements into the movie
	such as Apple, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, etc. The story that this movie tells
	is just a timeless classic.

<h3>The Fast and the Furious</h3>
<p>
	This has always been one of my favorites, simply because of the cars. I saw
	this movie for the first time with my dad as a kid and it ignited my love for
	cars. I went on to own lots of fast cars, all because of the seed that this
	movie planted.

<h3>The Santa Clause</h3>
<p>
	This movie is one of my favorites for nostalgia purposes. I used to watch it
	as a kid around the holiday's and i loved the sotry that it told. I watch it
	as an adult now because when i married my wife in 2014, we quickly realized
	that we both absolutely LOVED the Santa Clause movies. We watch all 3 of them
	every year around Christmas time. It's become a tradition for us.
